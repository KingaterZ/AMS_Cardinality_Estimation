# AMS_Cardinality_Estimation
This project is an implementation of AMS algorithms for cardinality estimation.

This project's aim is to reduce the memory use when counting the number of distinct elements in streaming data.
Using probabilitic counting with Morris Counter, the memory of recording a count of n is reduced from O(logn) to O(log(logn))
